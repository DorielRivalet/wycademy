# Wycademy Attribution Policy

## Definitions

To ensure clarity in attribution, copyright, and artistic discussions, the following terms are defined:

- **Raster Image:** A digital image composed of pixels (e.g., PNG, JPG). Raster images lose quality when resized.
- **Vector Image:** A digital image based on mathematical paths (e.g., SVG, AI). Vector images can be scaled without losing quality.
- **Vectorization:** The process of converting a raster image into a vector image, either manually (tracing) or automatically (software-assisted).
- **Derivative Work:** A new creation based on or adapted from an existing work. Depending on copyright laws, derivative works may require permission from the original creator.
- **Original Work:** A piece of art, design, or text created from scratch without directly copying or modifying an existing work.
- **Inspired Work:** A creation that takes inspiration from another work but does not closely replicate its composition, lines, or structure.
- **Attribution:** The act of crediting the original creator of a work. Attribution does not automatically grant permission for reuse.
- **Permission:** Getting explicit approval from the creator to use their work.
- **License:** A legal agreement that dictates how you can use the work (e.g., Creative Commons, MIT, etc.)
- **Public Domain:** Works not protected by copyright, either due to age or explicit release by the creator, and are free to use without restriction.
- **Fair Use/Fair Dealing:** Legal doctrines allowing limited use of copyrighted material under specific circumstances (e.g., commentary, education, parody). These rules vary by country.

## **1. Purpose**

Wycademy is committed to proper attribution of all assets, ensuring transparency, fairness, and respect for intellectual property rights. This policy outlines how attribution is handled for official assets, fan contributions, and original works within the Wycademy project.

## **2. Official CAPCOM Assets**

Certain assets used on Wycademy reference or are inspired by *Monster Hunter Frontier Z*, which is owned by **CAPCOM CO., LTD.** These assets are used under **fair use** for documentation, education, and community preservation. Wycademy is not affiliated with, endorsed, or sponsored by CAPCOM.

### **Usage of CAPCOM Assets**

- Screenshots, item icons, and in-game textures are used for educational and archival purposes.
- No assets are used for commercial purposes.
- If requested by CAPCOM, specific content will be removed.

## **3. Fan Contributions & Derivative Works**

Many assets within Wycademy have been created or modified by the community. These include custom icons, redraws, and reimagined assets that enhance the documentation.

### **Attribution Requirements**

- Contributors must be credited for their work in [our credits document](./CREDITS.md) with links to their original sources when applicable.
- If an asset is inspired by another, but significantly transformed, it will be marked as a **derivative work** and credit will be given accordingly.
- If an asset is nearly identical to an original work, it must have explicit permission from the original artist.
- When incorporating content from external sources, we strive to verify the original creator. If you believe an attribution is incorrect, please [contact us](https://github.com/Open-Frontiers/wycademy/issues), and we will investigate and correct it as needed.
- If a creator informs us that their work was misattributed, we will review the claim and update the credits accordingly. If a dispute arises, we will act in good faith to resolve it fairly.
- If an asset is no longer used in the project, its attribution is retained but updated to indicate it was previously included.

### **Request for Attribution or Removal**

- If you are an artist and believe your work has been used without proper credit, [please contact us](https://github.com/Open-Frontiers/wycademy/issues).
- If you wish for your work to be removed, please provide proof of authorship, and we will take appropriate action.

## **4. Wycademy Original Work**

The following assets and tools are considered original contributions by Wycademy:

- Custom-made vector redraws of existing game assets (stored in `/src/lib/client/components/frontier/icon`).
- Unique UI elements, calculators, and tools designed for the site.
- Speedrun database and site-specific content.

All original Wycademy assets are released under the **MIT License**, unless otherwise specified.

## **5. Disputes & Resolution**

If a dispute arises regarding attribution:

1. Wycademy will review both parties’ claims.
2. If necessary, Wycademy will request additional proof of authorship.
3. Content may be temporarily removed while the issue is being resolved.
4. Final decisions will prioritize proper attribution, fairness, and the interests of the Wycademy community.

## **6. Attribution vs. Permission**

Crediting someone does not automatically mean you have permission to use their work. Wycademy follows these principles:

- **Attribution** means giving credit to the original creator (e.g., "Artwork by X").
- **Permission** means getting explicit approval from the creator to use their work.
- **License** refers to a legal agreement dictating how a work can be used (e.g., Creative Commons, MIT, etc.).

## **7. When Credit Alone Isn’t Enough**

At Wycademy, we respect creators' rights. Credit alone is not sufficient in the following cases:

1. **All Rights Reserved Works:** If a work requires explicit permission, we will not use it unless granted.
2. **Licensed Works with Restrictions:** If a work has a license requiring specific conditions (e.g., non-commercial use, share-alike), we will comply.
3. **Unlicensed or Unclear Works:** If a work has no clear license, we assume all rights are reserved until clarified with the creator.

## **8. Proactive Attribution & Permissions Practices**

To prevent misattributions and ensure compliance:

- We will seek permission where required before using third-party works.
- We will verify sources before attribution to avoid miscrediting intermediaries.
- We will provide clear documentation for all attributions and licenses used on Wycademy.

For inquiries about attribution or permissions, please [contact us](https://github.com/Open-Frontiers/wycademy/issues).

## **9. Updates & Policy Changes**

This policy may be updated as needed. Changes will be publicly documented, and contributors will be notified when significant updates occur.
