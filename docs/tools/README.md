# Documentation Process for Tools

## Purpose

This document outlines the structured approach to documenting tools in Wycademy. It ensures clarity, consistency, and completeness while maintaining transparency in tool development.

---

## 1. Concept & Planning

- Define the purpose of the tool.
- Identify the target audience and their needs.
- Determine if similar tools exist and what improvements can be made.
- Plan features, usability, and any necessary limitations.

---

## 2. UI/UX Layout & Design

- Sketch wireframes or create mockups of the interface.
- Consider accessibility and ease of navigation.
- Optimize for mobile and desktop usability.
- Ensure a logical and intuitive workflow.

---

## 3. Code Development

### **HTML Structure**

- Define a clean and semantic structure.
- Use proper element hierarchy for clarity and accessibility.

### **CSS Styling**

- Maintain consistency with the Wycademy design system.
- Use responsive design techniques.
- Ensure proper contrast, font sizes, and readability.

### **JavaScript Functionality**

- Implement core logic with efficiency in mind.
- Use modular and maintainable code.
- Optimize performance and handle edge cases.

---

## 4. Internal Validation

- Test the tool against expected inputs.
- Check for any UI/UX issues.
- Validate performance across different browsers and devices.

---

## 5. In-Game Testing

- Test the tool’s output against actual game mechanics.
- Compare results with expected behavior.
- Record findings with screenshots or videos for reference.
- [Use the overlay](https://github.com/DorielRivalet/mhfz-overlay) to see more stats.

---

## 6. Documentation & Guides

- Provide a clear and concise guide for users.
- Include examples of input and output.
- Explain any limitations or known issues.

---

## 7. Sources & References

- List any external sources used for research or validation.
- Cross-check data from multiple reliable sources when possible.

---

## 8. Finalization & Release

- Ensure all steps are complete.
- Conduct a final round of testing.
- Deploy the tool and make it accessible on Wycademy.
- Announce updates via relevant channels (e.g., patch notes, forum posts).

---

### Notes on Open-Source Contributions

- All tools follow the MIT license, ensuring transparency and accessibility.
- Contributions must adhere to Wycademy’s documentation and coding standards.
- Forking and modifications are encouraged under FLOSS principles.
