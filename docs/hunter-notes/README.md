# Documentation Process for Hunter Notes

## General Research & Writing Method

To ensure high-quality, independent documentation, follow this structured process when writing or updating pages in Hunter Notes:

1. **Ask Questions**
   - What do players expect from this page?
   - What questions would they want answered?
   - Is there any original insight we can provide that isnâ€™t found in other sources?
   - Are there any common misconceptions that need clarification?

2. **Recall from Memory**
   - Based on personal experience, how would you answer these questions?
   - If errors arise later, note them in an *Errata* section rather than modifying the memory-based section directly.

3. **Verify with In-Game Testing**
   - Test mechanics, stats, interactions, and any relevant details directly in the game.
   - Take screenshots or record footage if needed for reference.

4. **Check Allowed Sources**
   - Review external sources listed in `README.md`.
   - Cross-check multiple sources when possible.

5. **Draft the Page**
   - Write a rough draft based on gathered information.
   - Include references using a Wikipedia-style `[1]` number system and a *See Also / References* section.

6. **Finalize the Page**
   - Format the content according to the Wycademy writing style.
   - Keep language simple and clear (for younger players and non-native English speakers).
   - Use US English spelling.
   - Structure sections logically for easy reading.
