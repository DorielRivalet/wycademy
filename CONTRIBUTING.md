# Contributing

## Status

Wycademy is still in active development, and many core aspects are
changing frequently. Because of this, we are holding off on formal
contribution guidelines for now. Once the site reaches v1.0, we will
provide clear instructions for those who want to contribute.

## Writing Style Guide

To keep Wycademy’s guides accessible, engaging, and easy to understand for players of all ages and backgrounds, please follow these writing guidelines when contributing content.

See our `./docs/hunter-notes/README.md` for more specific contribution guidelines for guides.

### Keep It Clear & Simple

- Use clear and simple English so that even younger players (13+) or non-native speakers can understand.
- Use **short sentences and simple words** whenever possible.
- Avoid unnecessary jargon—**if you must use a complex term, explain it** the first time.
- Break down complicated mechanics into **step-by-step explanations**.
- Prefer US spelling (e.g., armor instead of armour, analyze instead of analyse).

### Use a Friendly & Engaging Tone

- Write as if you're **talking to a fellow hunter**, not lecturing.
- Use **"you" and "we"** to make the guide feel approachable.
  - ✅ _Example: "You’ll want to bring a fire-resistant armor set."_
  - ❌ _Avoid: "The hunter must equip an armor set with adequate fire resistance."_
- Encourage players without being overly casual or using excessive slang.

### Structure for Readability

- Use **headings, bullet points, and bold text** to organize content.
- Keep paragraphs short (**2-3 sentences max**) for better readability.
- Highlight **key takeaways** so players can skim quickly.
- If applicable, **add images, diagrams, or interactive elements** to enhance clarity.

### Be Inclusive & Accessible

- Use **plain English** to accommodate non-native speakers.
- Avoid idioms or cultural references that might not translate well.
- Ensure colorblind-friendly formatting when using images or text highlights.

### Stay Accurate & Community-Focused

- Always **fact-check** your information before submitting.
- **Credit community research** where applicable.
- Keep an open tone—**don't gatekeep** or mock different playstyles.

### Example Edits (Before & After)

❌ **Before (Too Wordy & Complex)**
> "In order to effectively mitigate Nargacuga’s highly punishing counterattacks, the hunter must ensure that they are utilizing evasive maneuvers with precise timing, as well as selecting gear with Evasion+2."

✅ **After (Clear & Friendly)**
> "Nargacuga punishes mistakes hard, so **you’ll need good timing to dodge its counters**. Gear with Evasion+2 will help you react faster."

Following these guidelines ensures that Wycademy’s guides remain **helpful, easy to read, and welcoming for all hunters**.

## **Translating Wycademy Content**

Wycademy aims to be accessible to players worldwide. If you’d like to contribute translations, please follow these guidelines:

### Spanish Translation

- The **Spanish version will be manually translated** by Doriel Rivalet to ensure accuracy.
- If you notice any mistakes or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue or pull request.

### Other Languages

- You’re welcome to contribute translations for other languages!
- **Requirements for submitting translations:**
  - You **must be fluent in both English and the target language**.
  - The translation **must be accurate and natural**, not just a direct machine translation.
  - If possible, get **another fluent speaker** to review your work.

### How Translations Will Be Reviewed

- Since I can’t verify all languages, we’ll use **community feedback** to ensure quality.
- If a translation is low quality or inaccurate, it may be removed or revised.
- We may tag fluent community members for **peer reviews** before approving translations.

### Translation Formatting

- Translated guides should follow the same **writing style and structure** as the English version.
- Keep formatting, bullet points, and images consistent.
